Statistical analysis of the first assignment of Research Track I course (that you can find [here](https://github.com/PerriAlessandro/Automated-Robot-Navigation-with-Collision-Avoidance/blob/main/README.md)), which aims to compare the performances of the script I personally developed and a given one.
[Here](https://github.com/PerriAlessandro/Statistical_Analysis_Assignment1_RT1-/blob/main/Report_Statistics_Assignment1_RT1.pdf) you can find a detailed report of the work done.
